        "Gambler's ruin is the fact that a gambler playing a game with negative expected value will eventually go bankrupt, regardless of their betting system. (ref:wikipedia). The gamblers ruin problem is a particularly good example in demonstrating usage of the monte carlo simulation, and eventually a good application applying Random Walks in one dimonsion.\n",
